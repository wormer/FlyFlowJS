# Fly Flow

Fly Flow is an experimental game where you control a swarm of tiny dots (flies or ants) using gestures. The project is in its early stages, and I'm actively testing different mechanics, controls, and gameplay concepts.

## 📖 About the Project

The main idea is to experiment with swarm behavior and intuitive gesture-based controls. The gameplay and mechanics are subject to change as development progresses.

## 🚀 Development

This project is a work in progress, and I’m exploring AI-assisted coding to speed up prototyping. While AI helps break down tasks, I still refine and implement much of the logic manually.
